# Pro-ASP.NET-Core-MVC-2
This repository to save and track my progress working through the exercises and practices from the book: Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2, Seventh Edition

Party invites is a very simple web application that allows users to RSVP and respond to a party invite , whether or not they are going to the event.

In this exercise from the book, I chose to change it from party invites to study invites. Logically all of the backend processing are not changed. 

Just the data that is displayed.
